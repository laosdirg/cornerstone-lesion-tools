# Cornerstone Tools (Cacalc fork)

Main branch: `thresholding`

## Development
An example using region stuff is available in `/examples/regions/index.html` To run this, you must start a simple server in the root directory using e.g.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

The example is now available at `localhost:8080/examples/regions`
Furthermore, you must also run `npm run watch`.

The source is located in `/src/regions`.

The production code should be pushed to the `thresholding` branch.
